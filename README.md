About
=====

This is a Django-powered web app that allows multiple pull request statuses
(e.g. from Travis and Appveyor) to be combined into a single one. You can visit
the web app here:

This was developed as a quick hack, but if you are interested in helping
develop it further, please [let me know](mailto:thomas.robitaille@gmail.com)!
