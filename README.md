Obsolete
========
github can now handle multiple statuses without the need for a third party app.

About
=====

This is a Django-powered web app that allows multiple pull request statuses
(e.g. from Travis and Appveyor) to be combined into a single one. You can visit
the web app here:

[http://github-multi-status.herokuapp.com](http://github-multi-status.herokuapp.com)

This was developed as a quick hack, but if you are interested in helping
develop it further, please [let me know](mailto:thomas.robitaille@gmail.com)!
